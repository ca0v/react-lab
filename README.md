Typescript + TSX + React + RequireJS

* rawgit.html - loader
* app.tsx - the main component
* index.tsx - app extensions
* components - tag definitions
* built - static assets

## Building
* git clone https://github.com/ca0v/react-lab.git
* cd react-lab
* npm install

## All Examples
* [webpack-lab](https://rawgit.com/ca0v/react-lab/webpack-lab/build/index.html)
* [master](https://rawgit.com/ca0v/react-lab/master/rawgit.html)

## Known Issues
The current react typings have errors so tsc reports errors.  If you fix them don't run npm install again or your fixes will get wiped out.
